## Project Description
This website (front-end only) is the first project that I started developing after learning React.js library. I developed it as Single Page Application (SPA), which means that does not loading when moving between the pages and the speed and performance is higher than normal. I also developed Shirt Shop responsively for the all devices and used a template in Figma to design the home page UI for the desktop (https://www.figma.com/file/659k6lZ09BuOly6avuvt6U/Minimal-%26-Modern-eCommerce-Figma-Template-(Community)?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=Rh6aWTf4079mrRvV-0).
